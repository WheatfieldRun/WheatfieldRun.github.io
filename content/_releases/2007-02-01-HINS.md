<p>This album was an experiment to try and combine electronic inspired beats with driving guitars and ethereal vocals.</p>

<p>"I like how it begins very rock/poppy but then morphs into some all out electronic bliss." - Jeff Friesen</p>

<p>All songs recorded in the various bedrooms and basements i lived in between Winter 2006 and Winter 2007. Performed by Marlon except for the guitar on Transmissions from Space. That was Mitch. Thanks, Mitch!</p>
