## Description  

Recorded live off the floor in the wooden attic dubbed "The Summit" KONGRESS brings their precious gems in full force. Forged out of years of comradery and a desire to make unique "mix-tape" style music, your local Kongressmen bring you songs about meaningless choice, soaring scars and so many dead animals.
