## Description

<p>Queen Hazel and the If-Pigeons is a song novel (concept album) I conceived and created in the twilight of my 20's. A decade later, I rediscovered it and was inspired to continue work on the project.</p>

<p>I made a lithograph print around 2007 depicting a duel between Queen Hazel (the Queen of the Faeries) and the Pigeon King. The rest of the graphite illustrations were finished in June, 2015 and were used to decorate a self-published book of song lyrics which is included in the download of this album.</p>

<p>The entire Song Novel was recorded in my living room in July of 2015</p>
