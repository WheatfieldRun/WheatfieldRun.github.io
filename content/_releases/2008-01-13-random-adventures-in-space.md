## Description

The Secondhandpants tighten up their act in their latest effort, solidifying their musical style with their simple pop instrumentation, harmonies and witty lyrics.

This album hits you fast and hard, launching you into another universe with it's opening track "Blastoff!" and keeps it coming right through the album until Francis Leonard and Wyll Maynard attempt to fill an arena with ukulele rock with the track "Favorite Things".

This album must be heard to be believed.
