## Description

<p>So I've recorded a group of songs and did this funny stubborn thing where I kept them as one single track. But I ran into a roadblock in learning that you can't make your first upload to Bandcamp half an hour long. So here's this Fantastic Morning instead. It's one song. Just under six minutes. But I hope it picks you up and puts you down in a different place when it ends, as I hope the full album does when I can get it up here. So this is an in-the-meantime hello. Hi.</p>
