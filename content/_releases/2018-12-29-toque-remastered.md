## Description

<p>Originally recorded sometime between 2006-2008, it was the first album I ever made from start to finish. Energetic ukulele tunes contrasted with some young adult angst.</p>

<p>I thought the name Toque would be a good name for a band at the time. For those who aren't Canadian, a toque is a winter hat. </p>
