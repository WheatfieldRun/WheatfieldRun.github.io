## Description

This album has everything! It's got a ukulele. It's got the space bucket bass. It's got an 80's dance pop song about long underwear. It's got some tuned bottle bass action. It's got the stuck plunger trumpet. It's got Space Robot singing a spiritual. Literally. Everything.

Oh yeah. Francis Leonard and Wyll Maynard are on there too.
