## BIO

<p>It was fate when Francis Leonard (the goat-raised ukulele wielding man from Saskatchwan) met up with Wyll Maynard (the bucket-bass plunking man from outer space) in a secondhand store in Winnipeg.  From then on they aim to spread their particular brand of science fiction infused folk music, or Science-Folktion as they like to call it.</p>
